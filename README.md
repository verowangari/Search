The site uses the Github API to perform searches on Github, and display the results to the users.The website is made using angular js framework, and uses components, custom directives,routing modules and classes to make the finished product.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.2.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
